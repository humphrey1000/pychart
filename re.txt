Here are some engaging challenges to sharpen your skills with regular expressions in Python:

1. **Validate Email Addresses:** Create a regular expression to check whether a string is a valid email address. Test it with different cases like missing "@" or ".com".
    r"(\w+)?(@{1})(\w+)?(.{1})?(\w+)?"
2. **Extract Dates:** Write a regular expression to identify dates in various formats, e.g., "24/03/2025", "March 24, 2025", etc., and extract them from a given text.

3. **Count Word Occurrences:** Design a regex pattern to find how many times a specific word appears in a block of text.

4. **Find Phone Numbers:** Create a regex to extract phone numbers from a text. Account for different formats, such as "+254 712-345-678", "0712345678", etc.

5. **Detect Duplicates:** Write a regex pattern to identify duplicate words in a sentence (e.g., "This is is a test").

6. **Replace HTML Tags:** Create a regex to strip HTML tags or replace them with placeholders in a given HTML content string.

7. **Password Validation:** Build a regular expression to validate passwords based on specific criteria like length, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.

8. **Split Sentences:** Use regex to split a paragraph into individual sentences based on punctuation marks like ".", "!", or "?".
